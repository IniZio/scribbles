# Markdown might not be the best way to make notes...

## Not the best mid-term...

I allowed myself at least 1 week before the exams to prepare, and wrote the lecture notes with markdown during lessons to express how I understood what the lecturers and instructors said. 

The weird thing is that I tended to not trust my notes at all when revising, so I literally did not use any of my finished notes at all, and literally read the official powerpoint slides instead.  Even though I tried to read them side by side, it just felt not synced at all, and in the end I just hand-wrote what I summarized what I stuffed my brain with regarding the course into a small notebook.

This emergency act did not work at all, as this is more like someone not being able to devour the whole content at all and is forced to compress all the knowledge to what he think is more probable to be tested, and hope that those few pages will already contain the whole content.

It felt so wrong when I struggled with the exam questions, trying to squeeze what I remembered in the notebook, and could only wish I would pass at all. Some did, some did not, leaving me thinking: WTF...?

## What even is wrong?

Honestly speaking, although I did say in the title that I think how I made notes is the reason that I literally screwed up, maybe I should have realized earlier that I just ain't going to make it with current method? Maybe I am simply not investing enough time to revise, and should follow those mainlanders did? Or maybe I am not talented at exams at all so screw this..?

I am recently reading a book about making things simple, written by well-known Edward De Bono. That kept me thinking if I am just making the part of accepting knowledge too complex? It gave me a feel of organization when typing through the markdown notes, but it made me think before I actually type.

I have never been a fan of handwriting notes, given my 'lovely' handwriting and the contrast of markdown. Maybe I should change my opinions?

## Going to attempt changes

1. One lesson one post instead of one course one post, use pre-lession and pro-lesson
2. no more point forms, more biased to scribbles form
