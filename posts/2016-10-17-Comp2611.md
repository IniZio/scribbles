## T1

- Compilation process

## L5

### S-R latches(set-reset latches) (need to add circuit pic, graphical symbol)

- unclocked memory element
- creates the illusion that the data is saved as the value loops and stays the same forever
- R is used to reset or clear the element
- S is used to set the element
- if they are both not chosen, the output can be either 0 or 1.
- 'Quiescent' (i.e. quiet) state holds its previous state
- built with a pair of cross-coupled NOR(or NAND) gates
- Operations for S-R latches
  - both are de-asserted(low) then holds currernt value
  - reset is asserted(R=1) $\rightarrow$ value reset to 0
  - set asserted (S=1) $\rightarrow$ value set to 1
  - both asserted (INVALID INPUT) $\rightarrow$ both outputs equal $\rightarrow$ final state determined by the electrical properties of gates

### D-latch (D is data and WE is write enable) (need to add circuit pic, graphical symbol)

- when WE=1, latch is set to value of D
- when WE=0, latch holds previous value
- is combined with S-R to hold previous value
- 'registerfile': the package of registers in CPU (hardware)

### Bit sequences

- Shorthand notation: Q[3:0] (kind of like array slice)
- rightmost bit is bit[0], leftmost bit is bit[n-1]
- 'Addressable': number of bits per address in memory
- Memory of $2^2$-by-3 bit is made of 4 row by 3 column array of D-latches
- Sequential logic is not independent, it need to be designed in relation with others

## L6

### what you need to know about electrical circuit symbols and logical expressions

- recognize logical symbols, circiuit symbols and their matches
- recognize ![S-R latches](http://startingelectronics.com/software/VHDL-CPLD-course/tut9-SR-latch/S-R-latch-gates.png) and ![D-latchs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/D-Type_Transparent_Latch.svg/300px-D-Type_Transparent_Latch.svg.png)

### Calculating memory capacity:

- 32-bit memory address and byte-addressable $\rightarrow$ $2^32 locations and 1B/location$ $rightarrow$ 4GB

### Timing diagram:

- digital timing diagram: representations of a set of signals in the time domain
- contain rows, one being the clock

### Master slave D flip-flop

- built with clock-gated D-latches. C allows or blocks the input from D

#### Terminology:

- Latch: output can change anytime the clock is asserted
- Flip-flop: outputs can change only on clock edge

#### Falling-edge master slave D flip-flop

- output Q stores value of D when C is de-asserted
- when clock is asserted, D is updated in master flip flop, otherwise updated in slave flip flop and is visible in output Q

### sequential circuit

- combines combinational logic with storage
- remembers state and changes output according to current state and input
- 'state' of the system is a snapshot of all the relevant elements of the system
- 'clock' circuit frequently triggers transition from one state to another

### unsigned binary integrers:

- min: 0
- max: $2^k-1_{10}$
- representable range: [0, $2^k-1$]

### 2's complement

- Flip 0 to 1, 1 to 0. e.g. 1010 $\rightarrow$ 0101
- Add 1 to the value e.g. 0101+1 = $0110_{2}$ = $+6_{10}$
- representable range: [$-2^{k-1}$, $+2^{k-1}-1$]

#### Overflow and Underflow (signed integer)

- Overflow: Value larger than max representable integer
- Underflow: Value smaller than min representable integer

#### Zero extensions:

Filling missing bits when passing e.g. 24bit variable to 32bit register

### Scientific notation:

- A single digit to te left of the decimal poiont

#### Normalized scientific notation:

Scientific notation with not leading 0's

- ALl normalized binary bumbers always start with a 1 e.g. $1.xxxxx_2 * 2^{yyyy_2}$
- e.g. 5.75 = $1.01111_2 * 2^10_2$
- Exponent is more significant then significand, so is before it.

#### Floating point numbers

- approximate arithmetic
- finite range, limited precision

##### Single-precision floating point uses 32bits. 8 bit for exponent, 24 bit for significand

##### Double-precision floating point uses 64 bits

#### E.g. Give the IEEE754 representation of -0.75

- Scientific: $-0.11_2 * 2^0$
- Normalized: $-1.1*2^{-1}$
- Sign = 1 (negative), exponent = -1
- Single precision: S = 1, significant = 100000..00(32bits),
  biased exponent= (-1 + 127)_{10} (need to convert to binary)
- Double precision: biased = (-1 + 512)_{10}

## L7

### How to find decimal number represended by scientific notation

- $(-1)^6*(1+significand)*2^(exponent-bias)$

### Implicit 1

- Put more bits significand, increase accuracy

### Biased component

- for faster comparison (e.g. sorting).
- E.g comparing 1/2 and 2 is hard since with unbiased component 1/2 will in fact get more 1s. Bias component try to push both numbers bigger (i.e. above 0) before comparing. Therefore can do bit-by-bit comparison directly instead of parsing the value from the bit sequence first

### Precison of float values

- Its not perfect since when increasing from 0 to 1, the floating point will compensate with precision. Therefore the equal comparison is comparing the difference below thresholdd instead of exact equal

### Single precision range

- Draw a min and max positive number that is representable, and mirror it to the negative side.

| m    | e        | s       |
| :--- | :------- | :------ |
| min  | 0000..01 | 000...0 |
| max  | 1111..10 | 111...1 |

#### Underflow in floating point

- The close to zero value

#### Overflow in floating point

- Below min negative and above max positive i.e. great magitude

### Normalization, denormalization

- 'Data-representation' P.29 Table

##### A bit sequence can represent anything, so need a context (e.g. unsigned number) to find its meaning

### MIPS assembly language (gonna learn)

- words: instructions
- vocabulary: instruction set
- ISA (instruction set architecture): interface between hardware and system

### ISA(Instructon set architecture) includes

- native data types
- instructions
- registers
- addressing nodes
- memory architecture
- interrupt and exception handling
- exterrnal I/O

## ISA vs assembly language

- ISA: standard of public interface for processor for writing programs
- Assembly language: the symbols/syntaxes of the programming language, following the ISA

## T3

### Adding numbers in signed maginiture representation

- If have same sign: just add magnitudes
- If have different signs: substract the one with smaller magniture from larger one. The sign of result is the one of the larger one.
- Drawbacks: hard

### Adding one's complement numbers

- do unsigned addition of the numbers including sign bits
- take the carry out and take it to sum
- e.g. $0111_2+1011_2=1 0010 \rightarrow 0010_2 + 1_2 =0011_2$

#### Drawbacks

- two representations of 0
- need to take care of carry of addition

## Adding two's complement numbers

- just add them, then discard the carry out in the end
- e.g. $0111_2 + 1100_2 = 1 0011 \rightarrow (remove carry 1) 0011$

### Why works(T04 P.10)

- For a number B, its two's complement is $2^n -B$
- if A $>=$ B, the difference is positive, so discarding 1 will be same as deleting $2^n$, giving A-B
- else it will be negative and gets $2^n-(A-B)$, giving what we want

#### e.g. Convert $-1541.625$ to single precision floating point format

```
-1541.625
= $-(2^10+2^9+2^2+2^0+2^{-1}+2^{-3})$
= $-1.1000000101.101_2 * 2^10$
Sign = 1, Exponent = 10,
S = 1,
Biased exponent = 10 + 127 = 10001001
Significand = 10000001011010...0
\Rightarrow 1 10001001 1000001...0
```

#### e.g. Convert $-1541.625$ to double precision floating point format

```
S = 1,
Biased exponent = 10+1023 =...
Significand = 10000001....
\Rightarrow = 1 10000001001 1000001.........
```

## L8

#### Design principles of ISA

1. simplicity is good for regularity (e.g. each operation has fixed number of operands)
2. smaller $\Rightarrow$ faster
3. make common cases fast
4. good compromises for good design

#### For simplicity (1): E.g. of MIPS arithmetic operation

| MIPS        | C++      |
| :---------- | :------- |
| `add a,b,c` | `a=b+c`  |
| `add a,a,d` | `a += d` |

#### Register

- Operands of arithmetic instructions are registers, **NOT** variables.
- Registers are from limited number of special locations.
- Size of a register: 32 bits
- Number of registers in MIPS: 32 registers

##### Registers vs Variables

- variables are logical, and is unlimited
- registers are physical, and is limited

#### For smaller (2), fewer registers $\rightarrow$ shorter electronic signal travel

### Getting stuff from memory

- `lw $t0, 32($s0)` means loading a word(i.e. 1 byte) from `$s0+32` to register `$t0`. the '32' is like index in array (i.e. offset), but in bits so if `$s0` is variable A, then `32($s0)` is A[8]

#### Big Endian vs Small Endian

- Big Endian: end of word points to bigger address
- Small Endian: end of word points to smaller address

#### operands wave (ISA part 1 P.31)

- `$zero` is constant zero
  -`addi $t0, 10` means directly add a constant to `$t0`, there is **no** subi tho
- `sll $t2, $s0, 4` means `$s0 << 4bits` or multiply by $2^4$
- `srl $t2, $s0, 4` means `$s0 >> 4bits` or over $2^4$

#### For fast common case (3): use constant operands more

## L8

```assembly
# - we need to declare variables in a data segment
# - the compiler recognises .data as data segment
.data
h: .word 1 2 3 4 # h is an array, elements are 1 2 3 4, each with size 32 bit(a word)
s: .word 5

# these 3 lines mark the beginning of program
.text
.globl__start
__start:

# then start the code
la $s0, h # get starting address of array h, s0 = x
lw $s1, 8 # $s1 is content in memory address x+8 =3 = h[2]
```

#### Real instruction

- one-to-one mapping from the instruction to machine code

### 3 types of instructions in MIPS

- R-type for register
- I-type for immediate
- J-type for jump

#### Each type is assigned a unique set of value for 1st field i.e. opcode

#### Some operands e.g. sub, add, or, and use same opcode since they are handled by same hardware piece

#### R-type (arithmetic)

- op, rs, rt, rd, shamt, funct

#### I-type (data transfer)

- op, rs, rt, address

#### J-type

- op, const

## T4

#### ASCII data

```assembly
.data
a: ascii "abc"
```

- "z" means '\0'
- `.space <num>` means reserve `<num>` of bytes
- use `.global` to declare global label. it can be accessed acrosss multiple-file assembly program
- immediate instructions e.g. `li`, `move`, `addi` do not have corresponding machine instructions

e.g.1

1. a = a - 1

```assembly
# a in $s0
addi $s0, $s0, -1
```

1. b = a*5

```assembly
#a, b in $s0, $s1
sll $t0, $s0, 2
add $s1, $t0, $s0
```

1. A[3]=A[4]+7

```assembly
lw $t0, 28($s0)
addi $t0, $t0, 11actionCode
sw $t0, 8($s0)
```

1. A[c++]=A[b]+17

```assembly
sll $s1, $s1, 2 # shift b by 2 bits to multiply by 4, to get the offset
add $t0, $s0, $s1
lw $t1, 0($t0)lo
addi $t0, $t1, 16
sll $t1, $s2, 2 #multiply c by 2 bits
add $t1, $s0, $t1
sw $t0, 0($t1)
addi $s2, $s2, 1
```

## L9

### MIPS decision making: (Jumps to address)

- `beq reg1, reg2, L1 #branch if equal`: go to statement labeled L1 if reg1 == reg2
- `bne reg1, reg2, L1 #branch if NOT equal`
- even more:

```assembly
bgez $s0, label # >= 0
bgtz $s0, label # > 0
blez $s0, label #<= 0
bltz $s0, label # < 0
```

#### plain jump:

- `j L1 #just jump to label L1`
- `jr reg #jump to address stored in register reg`: used for switch, prodedure call

#### making if-elseif-else flow:

```assembly
		bne $s3, $s4, ElseIf
		#....
		j Exit #be sure to jump to exit in each branch
ElseIf: bne $s3, $s1, Else
		#....
		j Exit
Else: 	#...
Exit:
```

#### making loop:

```assembly
Loop  : #...
		bne $t0, $s5, Exit
		#... (mabe an increment)
		j Loop
Exit:
```

#### Since offset has to be a constant, if want to loop in an array will have to use temp to store the address and shift left it by <increment factor> bits.

### MIPS flag setting

- `slt reg1, reg2, reg3 #set reg1 to 1 if value in reg2 < reg3`
- `slti reg1, reg2, 1 # same but with immediate constant`

### Necesasry steps to call procedures

1. Place the parameters in place where the procedure can get them
2. transfer control to procedure
3. acquire storage resources needed for the procedure
4. perform the procedure task
5. place result in a place where the caller can access
6. return control to the caller breakpoint

## L10

#### Procedure calling:

- `$a0 - $a3`: **argument registers** for passing parameters
- `$v0 - $v1`: **value registers** for returning values
- `$ra`: **return address register** for returning to point of origin
- `$pc`**Program Counter**, address of current instruction
- `jal <ProcedureAddress>`; used in caller:
  - saves the address of following instruction to register `$ra`
  - then jumps to ProcedureAddress
- `jr`: mentioned before, used in called function to jump back to origin

#### flow of Procedure calling:

- Caller:
  - pass parameters:
    - put parameters in `$a0 - $a3`
    - use `jal <ProcedureAddress>` to jump to procedure
- Callee:
  - Perform calculations
  - return results in `$v0 - $v1`
  - return control to caller using `jr $ra`
  - caller gets result

#### Handling return for recursive functitons

- To not have `$ra`wiped out in recursive functions, we use `$SP` to stack the return addresses
- Callee pushes the return address at start and pops the stack pointer right before jumping back

#### Memory allocation

- Stack and dynamic data share same space, each going towards each other as they grow.
- Heap operation:
  - `malloc()` allocates memory, returns pointer
  - `free()`free spaces in heap
- Registers are illusions that make you feel like memory addresses are fixed, actually dynamic among different programs
- Text segment in memory: stores MIPS machine code, each code uses 12 bits to store
- 'Preserved on call': Stacks registers to make sure they are saved after any interruptions (e.g. function calls) in the function that called it. 

#### Flow to use stack (e.g. `strcpy(x, y)`)

1. stack stack for 1 more item (e.g. 4 bit): `addi $sp, $sp, -4`
2. save to a register (e.g. `$s0`), initialize as 0
3. To process each character in the arrays, save address of `x[i]` and `y[i]` to temp registers, assign `y[i]` to `x[i]`, check if last character (i.e. `== 0`), loop it
4. then restore `$s0` from `0($sp)` and pop `$sp$` once. Return to caller

## T5

##### e.g.2

```cpp
int i = 0;
int sum = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  if (i & 0x0001) == 1) sum += i;
  i++
}
```

$\to$

```assembly
addi $t0, $zero, 0 # i
addi $t1, $zero, 0 # sum
loop: 	slt $t2, $t2,yo $t0, 10 # compare with 10
		beq $t2, $zero, loopEnd
		addi $t3, $t0, 1
		beq $t3, $zero, NotIf
		add $t1, $t0, $t1
NotIf: 	addi $t0, $t0, 1
		j loop
loopEnd:
```

##### e.g. 3

```cpp
for (int c=0; c <= 10; c += 2) {
  A[c] = A[c+3]
}
```

$\to$

```assembly
addi $s0, $zero, 0
loop:	slti $t0, $s0, 11 # Since <11 is easier
		beq $t0, $zero, loopEnd # if the compare shows t0 is 0
		sll $t0, $s0, 2
		add $t2, $s1, $t1 # t2 is offset
		lw $t3, 12($t2)
		sw $t3, 0($t2)
		addi $s0, $s0, 2
		j loop
loopEnd:
```

##### e.g. 4

Find max value in an array

```assembly
lw $t0, 0($t1) # assume A[0] is max
addi $t1, $zero, 0 # index of A
loop:	addi $t1, $t1, 1
		slt $t2, $t1, $s2
		beq $t2, $zero, loopEnd
		sll $t3, $t1, 2 # process incremented index to offset
		add $t4, $t3, $s1 # A[i]
		lw $t5, 0($t4) # value of A[i]
		slt $t6, $zero, $t0
		bnq $t6, $zero, loop
		addi $t0, $t5, 0
		j loop
loopEnd
```

## L11

#### Dealing with 32 bit immediate

- We cannot handle registers' upper 16 bits with wt we learnt
- Solution: `lui $s0, 61`: load upper immediate, then `ori $s0, $s0, 2304` to load lower 16 bits too into register

#### Base addressing

- one operand is in main memory
- its address is sum of immediate and value in register `$rs`
- 16 bit immediate is a two's complement number
- E.g. `lw`, `sw`

##### You don't want the data to be killed upon jump since it may be needed by the next instruction

##### Re-visit memory space:

- text segment starts at 0x00400000
- Each instruction occupies 4 bytes
- last 2 digits of instruction address is always '00', so we can make it implicit and use 'word address', jumping word-by-word

#### Addressing for sequential: Just `PC+4`

#### Addressing for conditional jumps: PC-relative addressing mode

- basically, the compiler knows where u gonna jump, so it makes the address relative to the PC instead of absolute, such that even if u jump away, ur next statement can use the register in memory.

- // branch offset is added to (PC+4) to objtain address to branch to. The offset is desecribed in number of words

- // branch within $2^15$ words before or after the current instruction is possible, and is good enought as conditional branchs tend to branch to nearby instructions

- Flow:

  - before loading the instruction: pc loading the address
  - get the address
  - execute the instruction in address and PC += 4

- e.g. 

  ```assembly
  addi $s0, $s0, 1
  ```

#### Addressing for un-conditional jumps

- Direct addressing: address is immediate and canonot be embedded in 32-bit instruction

- Psuedo-direct addressing: 26 bits of address is embedded as immediate i.e. 4 bit of PC + 26 bit of address + implicit 2 bit '00'.

  - `beq $s0, $s1, L1` is often already gd enough, but for cases that need to go furthur than $2^{16}$, use 

    ```assembly
    bne $s0, $s1, L2
    j L1
    L2:
    ```

### Stretching max possible distance

- For branch target of offset, refer to 	number of words instead of number of bytes

## L12

### RISC vs CISC

- RISC: one simply action per instruction (e.g. MIPS)
- CISC: multiply actions per instruction (e.g. Intel instruction sets)

#### Performance from different aspects

- Algorithm: Number of operations
- Programming language/compiler: Number of machine instructions
- Processor, memory: Speed of executing each instruction and program
- I/O: Speed of executing I/O operations

##### Throughput(No. of jobs completed per unit time)

- not directly inversely proportional to response time as jobs can overlap

##### CPU time = CPU clock cycles for a program * Clock cycle time

## T6

#### `lui`

- e.g. `lui reg, constant`
- set the upper 16 bits of register reg to the value specified in constant
- set the lower 16 bits of register to 0

#### e.g. 1

- C++: `b=a+0x37cf0010`

- ```assembly
  # a,b in $s0, $s1
  lui $t0, 0x37cf
  addi $t0, $t0, 0x0010
  add $s1, $s0, $s0
  ```

#### e.g. 3

- C++: 

  ```cpp
  int minArray(int A[], int arraySize) {
    int min = A[0];
    while (i < arraySize) {
      if (min > A[i]) min = A[i];
      i++;
    }
    return min;
  }
  ```

- Assembly:

  ```assembly
  lw $t0, 0($t1) # assume A[0] is min
  addi $t1, $zero, 0 # index of A
  loop:	addi $t1, $t1, 1
  		slt $t2, $t1, $s2
  		beq $t2, $zero, loopEnd
  		sll $t3, $t1, 2 # process incremented index to offset
  		add $t4, $t3, $s1 # A[i]
  		lw $t5, 0($t4) # value of A[i]
  		slt $t6, $zero, $t0
  		beq $t6, $zero, loop
  		addi $t0, $t5, 0
  		j loop
  loopEnd
  ```


## L13

#### Performance matric = CPU execution time = instruction count $\times$ CPI (is an average value)('Cycles per instruction') $\times$ clock cycle time (hardware side)

#### Power = capacity load $\times$ $Voltage^2 \times$ Frequency

### SPEC ('standard performance evaluation cooperation') suite

- develops benchmarkds for CPU, I/O, Mail...
- for CPU, uses SPEC2006. faster if SPECratio (reference machine/ measured machine) is smaller

##### `addu, subu,... ` are actually operations that ignore overflow, not as it said unsigned operations. So when dealing with e.g.`addiu` 16-bit immediates, u extend the first bit to fill the upper 16bits i.e. sign-extended

### Scenerios for overflow to happen e.g. X+Y, X-Y

- For Addition: no overflow occurs when they are of different signs, otherwise occurs if of same sign but result represented in different sign
- For subtraction: no overflow occurs when they are of same signs, otherwise occurs if of different signs but result represented different sign from X

| operation | sign of X | sign of Y | sign of result |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | -------------- |
| X+Y       | 1         | 1         | 0              |
| X+Y       | 0         | 0         | 1              |
| X-Y       | 1         | 0         | 0              |
| X-Y       | 0         | 1         | 1              |

#### MIPS detect overflows with exception/interrupt

## L14

> Need to be able to draw the whole ALU for ADD, SUB,OR,AND,SLT,BEQ

### ripple carry ALU:

##### Ideal usage of ALU: build 32-bit ALU with 32 1-bit ALUs. Each only cares about the bit it is given, and all are the same except for the extra overflow detection in the one responsible for MSB .

#### 1-bit full adder(3,2 adder) also includes carrier in the addition, unlike half adder that only includes A and B.

Carryout(進位) = (b $\times$ cacrryin) + (a$\times$ carryin) + ab

#### Each ALU is not fully independent from each other, since each need to receive a carry in and pass carry out to other ALU. They share the same control signal.

#### ALU handling subtraction:

- Binvert: selector input to take different route for subtraction in the ALU
- Set Not gate and Set CarryIn in MLB to 1 since we need to use 2's complement for the negative number.

Making SLT work with ALU:

- `slt $t0, $s1, $s2`is equivalent to testing if (Rs-Rt) < 0
- we add a 'less' input, which defaults to 0, filling the 31bits of `$t0`that do not matter.
- binvert control signal(1 bit) passes in 1
- carryin control signal passes in 1
- operation control signal (2 bit, decides which output to pass out)passes in $11_2$, since SLT is fourth operation available in ALU.

Binvert and Carryin are always the same value, so they are actually merged. So the whole ALU control line is 3 bits, 1 bit for binvert and 2 for operation control signal

#### Carry lookahead: (pay hardware for time, by not waiting for previous bit before running and instead handle the previous bits' carryins themselves)

- since carry out happens if both bits are 1, we predict all carries at same time and do additions in parallel
- carryout are recursively handled, and is like promise.


## T7

##### Execution time = (No. of instructions for each instruction class $\times$ CPI for each instruction class) / Clock rate

##### CPI = (No. of instructions for each instruction class $\times$ Clock cycles required per instruction for each instruction class) / (No. of inctructions)

## L15

#### Multiplication

##### Multiplication for binary is kind of like that in decimal except that for addition part it carries out at 2

##### Components for multiplication:

- 64 bit multiplicand register
- 64 bit product register
- 32 bit multiplier register

##### Process for multiplication (v1.0)

- product register is initialized to 0

1. 32-bit multiplicand starts at right half of multiplicand register and is shifted left 1 bit at each step
2. multiplier register is shifted right 1 bit at each step
3. control decides when to shift multiplicand and multiplier registers and when to write new values to product register

###### There is a check bit that decides adding value to product if the multiplicand bit scanned is 1, else do nothing

##### Change in multiplication (v2.0)

- instead of shifting multiplicand, we shift the product right by 1 bit

##### Process for multiplication (v2.0)

- product register is initialized to 0

1. add multiplicand to product if multiplier bit is 1
2. shift product to right by 1 bit
3. shift multiplier to right by 1 bit
4. control decides when to shift product and multiplier

##### Change in multiplication (v3.0)

- since multiplier is 32 bit and product's last 32 bit is not needed initially and they both shift right, with multiplier disappearing in the end, we put multiplier into product register

##### Process for multiplication (v.3.0)

- product register's last 32 bits initialized as multiplier, rest are 0s

1. add multiplicand to product if multiplier bit in product register is 1
2. shift product register to right by 1 bit, which also shifts the multiplier
3. control decides when to shift product

###### for Signed multiplication where multiplicand and multiplier have different signs, product need to be negated

##### Separate pair of 32-bit registers for containing 64-bit product are `Hi` and `Lo`, uses command `mult` and `multu`

- `mflo $s1`: $s1 = Lo
- `mfhi $s1`: $s1 = Hi . can transfer Hi to general purpose register to test for overflow


## L16

#### Division

###### features shown in paper-and-pencil:

- divisor keeps moving to the right


- dividend does not move

##### Component for division:

- 64 bit divisor register (refined version: ==32 bit==)
- 32 bit quotient register(refined version: ==deprecated==, combined with remainder)
- 64 bit remainder register

##### Process for division(v1.0)

1. Divisor starts at left half of divisor register, shifts right 1 bit at each step
2. Quotient register initialized as 0, shifts left 1 bit at each step
3. Remainder register initialized with dividend
4. Control decides when to shift divisor and quotient registers, and when to write new values to remainder register

##### Change in division(v2.0)

- since only half of divisor register at most is used at a time, divisor register can be halved in size
- since divisor register and remainder shifts to right and left respectively, can simplify
- combine remainder and quotient registers since it is subtraction of dividend by quotient anyway

##### Process for division(v2.0)

1. divisor is subtracted from left half of remainder register, written back to left half of remainder register
2. right half of remainder register is initialized with dividend, left shift remainder register 1 bit before start
3. shift right back only the remainder in left half of remainder register

###### for Signed division where dividend and divisor have different signs, quotient and remainder need to be negated

###### similar to multiple-operation commands:

- `div $s1, $s2`: Lo = \$s1 / \$s2; Hi = \$s1 mod \$s2
- `divu $s1, $s2`: Lo = \$s1 / \$s2; Hi = \$s1 mod \$s2

#### Q4.

Bnegate = 1, Operation = 2 ($10_2$)



- ### Single cycle

  - assumption: every instruction finishes in one clock cycle

  - includes datapath and control

  - #### How an instruction is executed:

    1. Fetch instruction from memory indicated by Program Counter

    2. Decode instruction to know what to perform, gives control signal

       Meanwhile read source registers specified in instruction.

    3. Perform instruction

       - Arithmetic & logical: execute
       - Memory-reference: Use ALU for address calculation
       - Conditional branch: Use ALU for comparison

    4. Memory access e.g. `lw` and `sw`

    5. Write result to destination register by PC=PC+4 or change PC to branch target address

  - #### Building a single cycle datapath

    - Instruction memory: stores instructions, outputs instruction given its address
    - Program Counter(PC): store address of to-be-exec instruction
    - Adder: increments PC to address of next instruction

  - #### Combining datapath for R-type & Memory Instruction (`add` and `lw` and `beq` to one datapath)

    - ALUSrc: between step 2 and 3, to decide which source to be sent t ALU(read data or sign extend?)
    - MemtoReg: between step 4 and 5,  to choose the source of output back to dest register(read data or ALU result)

  - #### Single cycle control

    - memory element (R/W): instruction memory, register file, data memory

    - calculation element (ALU Control): ALU, Adder

      - ###### ALU Control:
        - 1-level decoding: more input bits
        - 2-level decoding: less input bits and simpler
        - Inputs used by control unit to generate ALU control input bits: ALUOp(2bit), Function code of instruction(6bit)

      - Implement ALU Control block:

        - start from truth table, for each operation have more don't-care items to have simpler logic

    - multiplexer

  - Datapath for load instruction

    1. PC gives read address
    2. Pass instruction to Control signal
    3. Pass instruction to ALU control
    4. ALU result pass result to data memory
    5. Data returned to register/write data

  - Datapath for branch instruction

    1. PC gives read address / add the address by required bits
    2. Pass instruction to Control signal
    3. Pass instruction to ALU control
    4. ALU result pass zero to data memory which will be ignored

  - Datapath for jump instruction

    1. PC's upper 4 bits concatenated with jump address memory address shifted by 2 sent out
    2. Control Signal calls Jump

  - Implementation of datapath control unit (Datapath&control P.25, P.33)

    basically a and-plane and or-plane graph, input are 6 signals(op0-op5), output are 9 signals(RegDst, ALUSrc, MentoReg, RegWrite, MemRead, MemWrite, Branch, ALUOp1, ALUOp0). We need to know the min-term

  - #### Problems with Single-Cycle: Not fast

    - Each instruction need one clock cycle, which is decided by longest path. The longest path is for load instruction

- ### Multi-Cycle

  - Definition: each instruction takes multiple cycles to execute, and broken to series of steps

    1. Fetch instruction

  - Advantages

    - Different instructions take their own time instead of longest path
    - Better sharing of function units $\to$ cheap

  - Trade-off

    - More temp storage e.g. instruction register, memory data register, register A & B, ALUOut
    - More complex control, need more multiplexer to handle whether to use shared hardware

  - Multi-cycle implementation of R-type

    1. [Fetch instruction] from data memory to IR
    2. [Decode & Read] Read out data in IR to register files
    3. [ALU Execute] Execute instruction in ALU and result passed to ALUOut
    4. [Return result] Result passed from ALUOut back to memory

  - New measures

    - All registers except IR only stores data for one cycle

    - Multiplexer: (can see different cycle using same hardware)

      - Multiplexing required for choosing the source as the address the memory module is not just PC but also data address
      - Multiplexing required for input to ALU since adders to compute next PC is removed, and is instead share ALU with execution of operation. 
        First Source to ALU is either A or PC. Second Source to ALU is either B, sign-extended imm, 4, or imm shifted left 2
      - Instead of 2$\times$4 possible combinations tho, the allowed combinations are PC+4, A op B, A + sign-extend(IR[15-0]), PC+sign-extend(IR[15-0]) << 2

    - Control signals added for new multiplexers:

      - PCWrite, PCWriteCond. used as PCWrite + PCWriteCond $\cdot$ condition.For deciding whether and what new PC to be written
      - IorD: source of address sent to memory. if 0 then get instruction, if 1 then get data
      - PCSource: decide whether to use PC+4, PC-relative or Pseudo address
      - IRWrite: enables write instruction register. If 1 then only upon instruction fetch. otherwise not just. 
      - Regwrite: control when MDR being written to register, so no need for control for MDR
      - ALUSrcA, ALUSrcB: ALU operations for branches/jumps sharing one ALU

    - Control unit design:

      - control signals for single-cycle only need a set of truth tables, sent in batch
      - control signals are specified for current and next steps in multi-cycle, i.e. Finite State Machine (P.45). it shows what control signal is needed for each cycle. All controls are read in step 1, which are then retrieved according to their needs in following steps

    - Finite State Machine

      - states & directions of how states change
      - Instruction Fetch & Decode

    - Microprogramming

      - Typical programming is for solving real world problems, microprogramming is solving the problems when doing the programming by 'programming controls we need'.

      - Like for FSM, we hard-code which state/control signal we need in a micro instruction

      - ###### Implementation of Miro-programming

        - Microprogram counter
        - Address select logic
        - Storage in ROMs and PLAs
